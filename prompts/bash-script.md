Don't write defensive code, just give me a prototype thats as short as possible while still being complete.

Don't give commentary.
Don't write error handling.
Don't write ANY comments.
Don't write ANY docstrings.

The code should be as short as possible without obfuscation. The code should implement the "happy path" of the requested functionality, and should not have "defensive code" that is only for error handling.

Assume everything is already installed. NEVER check for installed dependencies. Just use libraries and I'll make sure they are installed.
