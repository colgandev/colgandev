# Authentication Feature Development

We're working on adding user authentication to the FastAPI application.

## Requirements
- User registration and login
- Session management
- Protected routes
- Password hashing with bcrypt

## Current Status
The basic FastAPI app is set up with HTML components. We need to add:
1. User model with Pydantic
2. Authentication endpoints
3. Login/register forms using our HTML components
4. Session middleware

## Technical Notes
- Use FastAPI's security utilities
- Integrate with our existing HTML component system
- Follow the conventions in CONVENTIONS.md
- Keep the Bootstrap styling consistent
