This folder contains dumps of dconf settings for the Linux Mint Cinnamon desktop. It also includes some GTK settings and other things also stored in dconf.

The files in the base directory are common to all machines. Folders are settings specific to certain machines, allowing saving of panels and monitors and other things that wouldn't make sense on other machines.

The save and load cinnamon settings functions will intelligently pull certain keys specified in [[api/settings.py]]
